Sweep 'N Slash is a total conversion Add-On that introduces some of the combat aspects from Java Edition's 1.9 Combat Update into Bedrock Edition.

# How It Works

Minecraft Bedrock Edition's entities are data-driven, consisting of "components." Some of the mob behaviors are hard-coded, but many components can be overwritten with behavior packs. Attack component is one of them.
By setting the player entity's attack component value to a very large negative number, you can disable players' attacks entirely. This allows behavior packs to replace combat. Sweep 'N Slash makes use of that to add 1.9 combat aspects.

The major drawback of this method is that since it's most likely a bug, it causes unintended behaviors. And since everything is handled in server-side, it's not performance-friendly for large servers. (It was tested only in the LAN multiplayer.)

Also, since Bedrock's Scripting API lacks in reading/writing entity/item attribute components, it is not possible to read attack damage component for item stats. All the item stats have to be defined manually.

# Cross-Compatibility

This project uses [MCPE-IPC](https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC) for Cross-compatibility. It allows the add-on to have item stats defined by receiving scriptevents of item data from external behavior packs. This eliminates the hassle of having to modify the add-on's internal data.
